## Questions

### How long did this assignment take you and where did you spend your time?

Took about 3-3.5 hours. I wasted an hour trying to figure out what was going on with the date's and why the JSON data and dates dont match the design.
App setup (static) took 1 hour
App dynamic data / loading / click actions took 1 hour

### What would you do differently or improve in your solution?

I think if there was time I would love to implement a delete function.

### Do you have any feedback on this assignment

Enjoyed doing the assesment, was fun and creative.

But please see if you can give more information about the dates, and let the date_time match the screenshots. You can e.g. exlain in the spec to set the time of TODAY, so the date_time logic works e.g `const today = new Date('2021-04-12 23:12:38').getTime()`
